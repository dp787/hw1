User: I want to know if 210 grams of protein is good for me
Agent: Consuming 210 grams of protein per day may be excessive for most individuals unless you have specific dietary or fitness goals that require higher protein intake. The recommended daily intake of protein for the average adult is around 46-56 grams per day, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

However, if you are an athlete or bodybuilder, aiming to build muscle mass, or following a high-protein diet for weight loss, then 210 grams of protein per day might be appropriate. It is always best to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to determine the right amount of protein for your individual needs and goals. Consuming excessive protein can put strain on your kidneys and may lead to other health issues if not balanced with a well-rounded diet.
